# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to generate a predictive model of credit risk using historical loan data. Because credit risk is inherently an unbalanced classification problem (low risk loans greatly outnumber high risk loans), we need to employ various resampling methods and various machine learning concepts in order to find the optimal predictive model. 

## Results 
Below are the balanced accuracy scores of each machine learning model employed
